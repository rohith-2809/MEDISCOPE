 MediScope â€“ AI-Powered Disease Diagnosis and Medical Report Analyzer

Overview:
MediScope is an AI-driven platform designed to assist in medical diagnosis by analyzing lab and radiology reports. It uses machine learning models to interpret complex medical data and generate clear, structured, and easy-to-understand health insights for both patients and healthcare professionals. The goal of MediScope is to bridge the gap between raw medical data and actionable diagnosis through intelligent automation.

Objective:
To create a reliable system that can process uploaded medical reports (PDFs or images), extract the essential details, predict possible diseases or abnormalities, and summarize the findings in a professional yet patient-friendly format. MediScope aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility using AI.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React (Vite)

Backend: Node.js with Express

AI Service: Python (Flask) integrated with TensorFlow and NLP models

Database: MongoDB

Additional Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, OCR for text extraction

Key Features:

Upload lab or radiology reports in PDF or image format.

Automatic extraction of report data using OCR and text analysis.

AI-powered disease prediction using deep learning models.

Summarized results with clear explanations and recommendations.

Patient dashboard to view and manage past analyses.

Multilingual support for wider accessibility.

Secure and private processing of medical data.

Our Approach:
The MediScope system is built using a modular AI architecture that combines both NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Computer Vision components. The process begins when a user uploads a medical report. The system uses OCR to extract text and structured information from the file. The text is then processed by NLP models to understand medical terms, measurements, and abnormalities. In parallel, any visual content or scanned results are analyzed using CNN or ResNet-based models to detect patterns linked to diseases.

Once both text and visual data are processed, the results are merged and analyzed by a decision layer that predicts possible conditions and generates a medical summary. This output is formatted in an easy-to-understand report, often written in a doctor-like tone, providing explanations and suggestions based on the analysis.

Ethical AI practices are followed throughout the pipeline, ensuring that user data remains confidential and the AI provides transparent, explainable insights rather than direct medical advice. MediScope is not a substitute for professional consultation but an assistive tool to support healthcare professionals and patients.

Architecture Summary:

The frontend handles user interactions and file uploads.

The backend (Node.js) manages routing, authentication, and communication with the AI microservice.

The Python-based AI microservice performs report analysis, NLP processing, and disease prediction.

All results and user histories are stored in MongoDB for secure and easy retrieval.

Use Case Example:
A user uploads a lab report showing abnormal hemoglobin levels. MediScope automatically detects the low values, anal
